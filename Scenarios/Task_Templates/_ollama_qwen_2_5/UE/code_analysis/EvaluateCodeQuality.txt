I have the following Unreal Engine code that needs review and improvement:

<place code here>

Your task is to analyze the code and suggest enhancements focusing on the following aspects:
- Readability: Identify unclear parts and suggest clearer alternatives with code examples.
- Maintainability: Point out non-modular or hard-to-maintain structures and provide modular, maintainable code examples.
- Performance: Highlight performance bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, or expensive operations and offer optimized code snippets.
- Blueprint/C++ Best Practices: Indicate deviations from Unreal Engine best practices and correct them with code examples.
- Memory Management: Identify potential memory leaks, improper garbage collection usage, or inefficient resource handling with suggested fixes.
- Networking: If applicable, review network-related code for replication issues, bandwidth optimization, or security concerns.
- Game Thread Usage: Identify operations that could block the game thread and suggest alternatives (async tasks, threading, etc.)
- Documentation: If documentation/comments are lacking or unclear, suggest better documentation with examples following UE4/UE5 standards.
- Scalability: Comment on how well the code would scale with increased game complexity and suggest improvements.
