I have the following React app code:

<place code here>

Your task is to migrate this code to Angular 14.x.
When performing the translation, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Use common libraries: @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects.
- Split the code into separate components.
- Optimize the code where possible.
- The converted code should not contain any TODOs.
- Return the translated code as markdown code snippets.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments or explanations on how to convert it.
