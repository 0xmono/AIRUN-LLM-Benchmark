I have the following jQuery app code:

<place code here>

Your task is to translate this code to React 18.x.
When performing the translation, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Use the following libraries: Create React App, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit with createSlice, and nanoid.
- Provide a package.json file and configure the store and provider.
- Split the code into separate components.
- Optimize the code where possible.
- The converted code should not contain any TODOs.
- Return the translated code as markdown code snippets.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments or explanations on how to convert it.
