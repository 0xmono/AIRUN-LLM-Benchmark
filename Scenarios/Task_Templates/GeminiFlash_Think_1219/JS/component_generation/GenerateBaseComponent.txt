Your task is to create a general component on React 18.x.
You should create a searchable select component with accessibility support.

When completing the task, ensure to adhere to the instructions below:
- Use TypeScript to create the component.
- It should have a search feature in the dropdown.
- It should be navigable via keyboard and select items on the Enter key.
- The dropdown list should open when Enter is pressed.
- After closing the dropdown, focus should return to the select component.
- The dropdown should close upon selecting an item (via keyboard or mouse), pressing Esc, or clicking outside.
- Provide an index.css file.
- The generated code should not contain any TODOs.
- Simply return the codebase without additional comments.
