When completing the task, ensure to adhere to the following instructions:
- Add clear and descriptive comments to all methods and significant code blocks.
- Include purpose and functionality explanations for each method.
- Document parameters, return values, and important side effects.
- Explain any complex logic or algorithms.
- Note important Unreal Engine-specific patterns or conventions being used.
- Highlight any performance considerations or potential edge cases.
- Use standard comment formats (// for single line, /* */ for multi-line).
- Add class-level documentation at the top explaining the component's overall purpose.
- Include any important usage notes or limitations.
- Ensure comments follow Unreal Engine documentation standards.
- The comments should make the code more maintainable without changing any functionality.
- Do not modify the actual code logic, only add comments.
