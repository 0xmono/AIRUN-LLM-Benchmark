I have the following application code that needs review and improvement:

<place code here>

Your task is to analyze the code and suggest enhancements focusing on the following aspects:

- Maintainability: Point out non-modular or hard-to-maintain structures and provide modular, maintainable code examples.
- Performance: Highlight performance issues and offer optimized code snippets.
- Accessibility: Suggest improvements for better accessibility with example code.
- Best Practices: Indicate deviations from best practices in the used tech stack (e.g., React, TypeScript) and correct them with code examples.
- Testing: Comment on testability and suggest testable code structures with example tests.
- Documentation: If documentation/comments are lacking or unclear, suggest better documentation with examples.
